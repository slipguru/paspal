Introduction
============

This set of MATLAB toolboxes contain an implementation of the
regularization algorithms described in the papers:

"Solving Structured Sparsity Regularization with Proximal Methods";
by Sofia Mosci, Lorenzo Rosasco, Matteo Santoro, Alessando Verri, Silvia Villa;
ECML 2010, Barcelona, Spain.

"A Primal-dual algorithm for group lasso with overlapping groups";
by Sofia Mosci, Alessando Verri, Silvia Villa, Lorenzo Rosasco;
NIPS 2010, Vancouver, Canada.


The toolboxes are:
1) L1L2_TOOLBOX (Lasso and Elastic net Regularization)
2) GROUP-LASSO_TOOLBOX (Group lasso)
3) MULTI-TASK_TOOLBOX (Multi-task learning or Joint Features Selection)
4) GLO_PRIMAL_DUAL_TOOLBOX (Group-Lasso with Overlap, primal-dual optimization)


Each toolbox contains:
-<ALGORITHM>_algorithm.m: the learning algorithm
-<ALGORITHM>_regpath.m: function for computing the regularization path
-<ALGORITHM>_kcv.m: function for performing the K-fold/LOO cross-validation framework
-<ALGORITHM>_tau_max.m: function estimating the maximum value for the regularization parameter  
-<ALGORITHM>_learn.m: function for building a predictive model for a given value of the regularization parameter
-<ALGORITHM>_pred.m: function for predicting the labels on a data set given the model returned by <ALGORITHM>_KCV.m

The algorithms names are "l1l2" for l1l2 regularization,
"grl" for Group-l1l2 regularization, and "glopridu" for group lasso with overlap.   
For usage details, type  "help <FUN_NAME>" (e.g. "help l1l2_kcv") at the MATLAB prompt.

There is a "utilities" folder included and 2 demos:
-demo_kcv.m: showing how to perform cross-validation with l1, l1l2, group lasso, and multi-task learning.
-demo_glopridu_kcv.m: showing how to perform cross-validation with group lasso with overlap.
